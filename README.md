# check_mk_checks
Some check_mk checks I've created

The Billion checks have been tested against a 7800VDOX.

The Barracuda checks have been tested against a virtual spam firewall - so I didn't bother with any of the physical hardware metrics.

I use OMD, which means I place these checks in the individual sites "~/local/share/check_mk/checks" directory.

Any of the pnp-templates go in "~/local/share/check_mk/pnp-templates"
